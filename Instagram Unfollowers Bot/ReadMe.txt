It need you to install chrome web driver, you should download it compatible with your chrome webbrowser, version numbers should be same.
Therefore, check your browser version at abouth then download it from here:

https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

extract the file, take only chromedriver.exe and put it in windows folder. 

then type this to console: pip install selenium 

#pip install selenium necessary
#selenium==3.141.0
#urllib3==1.25.7
#Use web driver version what your chrome web browser's version is and copy it to this path: c:/windows . In this, we used 80 version.
